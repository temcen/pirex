# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The recommendation engine is a comprehensive, multi-modal system designed primarily for e-commerce product recommendations while maintaining flexibility to adapt to other domains (videos, articles, etc.). The system follows a monolithic architecture with strong separation of concerns through distinct services and layers. It will start as an MVP focusing on core recommendation functionality with text and image content, then evolve through phases to include advanced features like graph neural networks, real-time learning, and sophisticated diversity controls. The engine prioritizes functionality over scale initially, targeting mid to low-scale deployments with sub-second response times.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Ingestion and Processing Pipeline

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ingest catalog content (products, videos, articles) through a robust pipeline, so that the recommendation engine has clean, processed data with rich embeddings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is submitted via Content Ingestion API THEN the system SHALL validate and normalize the data structure
2. WHEN content passes validation THEN the system SHALL send it through the Internal Message Bus to the Data Preprocessor
3. WHEN the Data Preprocessor receives content THEN it SHALL clean text, normalize images, extract features, and prepare data for embedding
4. WHEN preprocessed data reaches the Unified Embedding Service THEN it SHALL generate text embeddings, visual embeddings, and multi-modal fused representations
5. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in PostgreSQL with pgvector and metadata in structured format
6. IF any step in the pipeline fails THEN the system SHALL log errors, alert administrators, and provide graceful fallback handling

### Requirement 2: User Interaction Tracking and Profile Management

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want all my interactions (ratings, likes, clicks, views, search queries, browsing behavior) to be captured and processed, so that the system can build an accurate profile and improve recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts through the User Interaction API THEN the system SHALL capture explicit feedback (ratings, likes, shares) and implicit feedback (clicks, views, watch time)
2. WHEN search queries and browsing patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL log them for behavioral analysis
3. WHEN interactions are captured THEN the system SHALL update user profiles in real-time and store relationships in Neo4j
4. WHEN user behavior changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the user's preference vector and graph connections accordingly
5. WHEN interaction data is processed THEN the system SHALL respect privacy settings and data retention policies

### Requirement 3: Multi-Strategy Recommendation Generation

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want to receive personalized recommendations that combine multiple algorithms and strategies, so that I get the most relevant and diverse suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Unified Computation Service processes a recommendation request THEN it SHALL execute semantic search in vector space, analyze graph signals, and apply personalized PageRank
2. WHEN the Recommendation Orchestrator receives algorithm results THEN it SHALL decide which strategies to use based on user context and combine results intelligently
3. WHEN the Ranking Service processes combined results THEN it SHALL apply ML models considering content, user, and context features
4. WHEN the Diversity Filter processes ranked results THEN it SHALL ensure variety, avoid redundancy, and balance novelty vs relevance
5. WHEN recommendations are finalized THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds with no duplicates

### Requirement 4: External System Integration and Context Enrichment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to integrate with external systems (CRM, social media, weather services) to enrich recommendation context, so that suggestions are more contextually relevant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN External System APIs are configured THEN the system SHALL connect with CRM systems, social media platforms, and contextual services
2. WHEN external data is available THEN the system SHALL enrich user profiles and recommendation context without blocking core functionality
3. WHEN external systems are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached or default context data
4. WHEN external data is integrated THEN the system SHALL synchronize data between platforms while respecting rate limits and API quotas

### Requirement 5: Multi-Layer Caching and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want fast recommendation responses, so that my browsing experience is smooth and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL cache them in long-term storage for reuse across sessions
2. WHEN metadata is frequently accessed THEN the system SHALL cache it in Redis/Memcached for sub-second retrieval
3. WHEN graph computation results are generated THEN the system SHALL cache them short-term for immediate reuse
4. WHEN user-specific recommendations are computed THEN the system SHALL cache them with appropriate TTL based on user activity patterns
5. WHEN cache hits occur THEN the system SHALL serve responses in under 500ms
6. WHEN cache misses occur THEN the system SHALL still respond within 2 seconds while populating caches for future requests

### Requirement 6: Authentication, Security, and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust authentication and access control, so that the system is secure and properly manages user sessions and API access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the system THEN the Authentication Service SHALL validate credentials and manage secure sessions
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limiting and quotas based on user tiers
3. WHEN sensitive data is processed THEN the system SHALL ensure privacy compliance and data security
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log security events and block malicious requests

### Requirement 7: API Gateway and Client Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified API gateway that provides clean REST/GraphQL interfaces with explanation capabilities, so that I can easily integrate recommendations into client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Gateway receives requests THEN it SHALL provide both REST and GraphQL endpoints as a single entry point
2. WHEN client applications request recommendations THEN the system SHALL aggregate data from multiple internal services seamlessly
3. WHEN explanations are requested THEN the Explanation Service SHALL generate transparent reasons for recommendations to improve user trust
4. WHEN API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL manage multiple versions without breaking existing integrations
5. WHEN responses are returned THEN they SHALL include recommendation explanations, confidence scores, and reasoning when requested

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Learning and Feedback Integration

**User Story:** As a consumer, I want the system to learn from feedback and continuously improve recommendations, so that suggestions become more relevant over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user feedback is received THEN the system SHALL update user profiles and model weights in near real-time
2. WHEN negative feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL reduce similar recommendations and update user preference vectors
3. WHEN positive feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL strengthen similar patterns in both vector space and graph relationships
4. WHEN the Internal Message Bus processes feedback events THEN it SHALL handle traffic spikes and ensure no feedback is lost
5. WHEN model updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain service availability without interruption

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of recommendation quality, system performance, and user engagement, so that I can optimize the engine and detect issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Monitoring Dashboard operates THEN it SHALL track recommendation performance, quality metrics, and user engagement in real-time
2. WHEN system components experience issues THEN the system SHALL generate alerts with diagnostic information and suggested remediation
